Differences:

Petitions:
GET - Reference checks if there is a categoryId with that number, whereas mine will simply return empty if there is no categoryId with that number

POST - Reference results in a 500 error for invalid end date, whereas mine creates an entry with a null end date.

GET by ID: Reference uses null without quotation marks for a petition with no closingDate. Mine has null with quotation marks. References uses null for signatureCounts for a petition with no signatures, whereas mine uses 0. Order of key-value pairs are different.

PATCH - Same as in POST. Reference results in a 500 error if there is no category for that ID

Users:
POST - Reference allows empty strings (" ") whereas mine does not.
